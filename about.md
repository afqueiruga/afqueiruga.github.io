I am a post doctoral researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory working in the
[Earth and Environmental Sciences Area](https://eesa.lbl.gov).
I design novel numerical methods and algorithms for scientific problems involving multiphysics, multiphase flows and discontinuities. My present research is focused on developing computational methods for:

1. hydraulic fracture extension,
2. geomechanical modeling coupled to hydrological flows, and
3. numerical algorithms for large-scale hydrological flow simulations.

Broadly, my research interests encompass meshless methods, Finite Element methods, microstructure-based models, discrete element models and electrodynamics.

In my tool-sharpening efforts, I design meta-programming packages for scientific computing to use in my everyday work for techniques such as automatic differentiation and basis function generation. I am in the process of developing a domain-specific language and associated runtime package for use in general numerical codes.
