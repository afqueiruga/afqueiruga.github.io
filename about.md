I am a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory working in [Earth and Environmental Sciences](https://eesa.lbl.gov).
I design novel numerical methods and algorithms for scientific problems involving multiphysics, multiphase flows and discontinuities. My present work is focused on developing computational methods for:

1. automated runtimes for multiscale simulation,
1. oceanic gas hydrate reservoirs,
1. hydraulic fracture extension,
2. geomechanics coupled to hydrogeological flows, and
3. multiphase transport in geologic media.

Broadly, my research interests encompass meshless methods, Finite Element methods, microstructure-based models, discrete element models and electrodynamics.

In my tool-sharpening efforts, I design meta-programming packages for
scientific computing to use in my everyday work for techniques such as
automatic differentiation and basis function
generation. [Cornflakes](https://bitbucket.org/afqueiruga/cornflakes) and [popcorn](https://bitbucket.org/afqueiruga/popcorn) are the current incarnation
of this work.
