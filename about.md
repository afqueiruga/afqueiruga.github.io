# Bio
<img align="right" src="images/mug.png" width="250" style="margin:25px 25px">

I completed my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley in the spring of 2015, and received a M.Sc. in 2013. My dissertation title is "Microscale Simulation of the Mechanical and Electromagnetic Behavior of Textiles." I received a B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2011.

I design novel numerical methods and algorithms for scientific problems involving multiphysics, multiphase flows and discontinuities. My present research is focused on developing computational methods for:

1. hydraulic fracture extension,
2. geomechanical modeling coupled to hydrological flows, and
3. numerical algorithms for large-scale hydrological flow simulations.

Broadly, my research interests encompass meshless methods, Finite Element methods, microstructure-based models, discrete element models and electrodynamics.

In my tool-sharpening efforts, I design meta-programming packages for scientific computing to use in my everyday work for techniques such as automatic differentiation and basis function generation. I am in the process of developing a domain-specific language and associated runtime package for use in general numerical codes.
