Before I decided on this website format, I was experimenting with just putting markdown + jupyter notebooks into a repository. There's a collection of IPython notebooks and utilities at this repository:

[afqstensorflowexamples](https://github.com/afqueiruga/afqstensorflowexamples)

My active work will be documented in new notebooks I add to that repository, and utility functions will be added there for now. I'm not sure how I feel about reporting in Jupyter notebooks, but I do end up using them (easiest way to get plots when using the Docker image), and Github will just render them.
