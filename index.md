I am a numerical computation researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory working in [Earth and Environmental Sciences](https://eesa.lbl.gov)
My skill set includes:

1. Solution and optimization of nonlinear problems,
1. Software engineering and algorithm design for number-crunching applications,
1. Analysis of the accuracy and stability of numerical algorithms,
1. Syntax tree manipulation and generation, and
1. Computation on parallel systems and exotic hardware.

I design novel numerical methods and algorithms for scientific problems involving multiphysics, multiphase flows and discontinuities. My work in Energy Geosciences is currently directed towards tackling the following problems:

1. Predicting the responses of oceanic gas hydrate reservoirs,
1. Imaging of geophysical processes through simulation inversion,
1. Solving transport along fracture networks during fracture
propagation, and
1. Developing new multiscale techniques for watershed-scale problems.


In my tool-sharpening efforts, I design meta-programming packages for
scientific computing to use in my everyday work for techniques such as
automatic differentiation and basis function
generation.
[Cornflakes](https://github.com/afqueiruga/cornflakes) and [popcorn](https://github.com/afqueiruga/popcorn) are the current incarnation
of this work.
