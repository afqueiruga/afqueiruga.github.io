I'm a researcher in computational methods. I care about designing the ways we describe our problems, the tools we use to turn those descriptions into code, and the tools we use to check those programs. At Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory working in [Earth and Environmental Sciences](https://eesa.lbl.gov), my efforts are directed towards improving how we analyze subsurface energy resources.

I used to think I was pretty good at deriving equations and writing programs, but now I think my computer can do a better job at both of those things. Metaprogramming methods have proved invaluable for empirical studies; [cornflakes](https://github.com/afqueiruga/cornflakes) and [popcorn](https://github.com/afqueiruga/popcorn) are a general-purpose runtime and symbolic generation package. The benchmarking and verification solutions I've compiled over the years have spun out into an automated test suite, [detest](https://github.com/afqueiruga/detest). Lately, I have been working on machine learning and differential programming methods to seek new ways of describing and solving physical systems. Some of my active work can be found on Github and in my hosted [presentations](CV)

There are links to as many of my publications as possible on the [CV](CV) page of this site. Conference presentations also have links: I use reveal.js/Jupyter nowadays so that the slide decks can be viewed in the browser (with interactive widgets!)
