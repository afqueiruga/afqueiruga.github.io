# Hydraulic Fracture Extension


A peridynamics model is used to simulate the hydraulic fracturing process fully coupled to finite-element models of porous flow and fracture flow. The growth of the fracture is modeled by weakening and breaking bonds between peridynamic material points in response to the strain. Fluid injection drives the growth of the initial hydraulic fracture and interacting with a natural fracture to the left. Below the peridynamic points are plotted, colored by the y displacement.
Not shown in the video are the fields for matrix-pore pressure and fracture pressure.

# Electronic Textiles in Ballistic Impacts


High strength textiles are a fundamental component of armors in multiple applications, where they are coupled with metal and ceramic plates and various other systems. In this research, the effect of applying electromagnetic fields to a ballistic fabric undergoing impact is explored, wherein an external magnetic field induces deformation in an electrified sheet to influence the behavior of the projectile.

# Image Processing in Impact Experimentation

A silicone ballistic block was embedded with a grid using thread and ink. A baseball is fired at the block, and custom image processing software is used to track the grid. A better camera is needed to be able to follow all of the points.

# DEM Simulations of a Granular Shear Cell

A discrete Element simulation is used to obtain local flow properties of a granular media inside of an anular shear cell. Particles are affixed to the inside wheel of the shear cell that rotates at a constant rate. Contacts between particles and between particles and the boundary resolved by a soft-sphere Hertzian spring-dashpot normal force and a history-based frictional force.
